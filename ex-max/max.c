     *  Write a program max that finds the maximum value from a list L of k integers.

     *  Instead of doing this with a loop, solve this question with recursion. 
     *  Fill in this function that calls itself recursively and returns the 
     *  maximum value among the array elements list[start] .. list[end - 1]. 

     *  Note end is non-inclusive, i.e., the last element in the array is list[end - 1].

     *  Some things to consider:
     *    1. If you recurse index by index, you WILL overflow the stack for large k. 
     *    2. Is there a way to reduce the size of the problem by half at each step?
