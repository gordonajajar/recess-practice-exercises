      Write a program max that finds the maximum value from a list L of k integers.

      Instead of doing this with a loop, solve this question with recursion. 
      Fill in this function that calls itself recursively and returns the 
      maximum value among the array elements list[start] .. list[end - 1]. 

      Note end is non-inclusive, i.e., the last element in the array is list[end - 1].

      In the function definition above, the keyword const (short for constant) is 
      used to annotate that the array list is meant to remain unchanged.

      The program should read the following from the standard inputs:
      The first number is a positive integer k
      The next k numbers correspond to the list of integers L.

      The program should then print the largest integer from the list to the standard output.

      k is guaranteed to be no more than 100000. We use a fixed-length array on the 
      stack to store the inputs. The main function to read the inputs and print the 
      maximum value has been given. You should not change the main function.

      Since you are supposed to solve this problem with recursion, you are not allowed to use 
      loops of any kind (for, while, do-while) inside the function find_max. Solutions that use 
      loops inside find_max is considered incorrect.
