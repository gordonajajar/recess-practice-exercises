     *  For example, the largest possible number we get by rearranging the digits in 6752378 is 8776532.
     *  The largest possible number we get by rearranging the digits in -1010 is -11.

     *  Finish this program called largest that reads an integer from the standard input 
     *  and prints to the standard output the largest possible number we get by rearranging the digits in n.

     *  Solve this by using a fixed-length array (frequency table) in this function.

     *  The main function is written for you in largest-main.c. Only edit this file.

     *  Some things to consider:
     *    1. How do you extract the digits in n one by one, not knowing its length?
     *    2. What is the difference in building the largest number when given positive versus a negative n?
